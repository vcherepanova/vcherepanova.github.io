I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computing at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by Prof. Tom Goldstein. 
My research focuses on various topics in machine learning ranging from fairness and robustness of deep neural networks to tabular deep learning. 
Currently, I am exploring mechanisms for aligning large language models and methods for detecting AI generated text. 
During my PhD I did two summer internships at Amazon, in 2021 I developed NLP solution to monitor integrity and transparency of third-party Alexa Skills at Alexa Monitoring
team and in 2022 I worked on improving Alexa Voice Search on FireTV at Alexa Entertainment team. 

Prior to my PhD I received bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Higher School of Economics (Moscow) and master’s degree in modeling biological complexity from University College London (London).
