I am a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon AWS Responsible AI. Currently, I am working on problems related to safety and security of large language models. 
The development of LLMs introduces great capabilities, but we continue to identify new vulnerabilities and failure modes of these systems, and we still do not understand their inner workings. 
In my research I explore robustness of language models to out-of-domain inputs, and jailbreak attacks, detectablity of AI generated text, and biases in these models. 
Another area of interest to me is deep learning for tabular problems, my goal is to advance machine learning in tabular domain beyond traditional decision tree models. 

Prior to joining Amazon I did my PhD at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by Prof. Tom Goldstein and worked on various topics in machine learning ranging from fairness and robustness of deep neural networks to tabular deep learning. 
During my PhD I did two summer internships at Amazon, in 2021 I developed NLP solution to monitor integrity and transparency of third-party Alexa Skills at Alexa Monitoring
team and in 2022 I worked on improving Alexa Voice Search on FireTV at Alexa Entertainment team.

I am always looking for new collaborations,
